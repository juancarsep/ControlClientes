# Java Web Application with Maven: Client Management CRUD

## Overview
This repository contains a Java web application built with Maven for dependency injection. It utilizes Glassfish Server for local server deployment and MySQL Workbench as the database management system. The Java project is centered around a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for client management. Each client is identified by an ID and includes attributes such as name and balance, which can be edited and deleted. The application is developed using Java classes, JSPs (JavaServer Pages), and Servlets. Additionally, HTML and CSS with Bootstrap are employed for the visual presentation.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Maven:** Dependency management tool for the project.
- **Glassfish Server:** Used for deploying the web application locally.
- **MySQL Workbench:** Database management system for data storage and retrieval.
- **JSPs and Servlets:** Java-based technologies for server-side processing.
- **HTML:** Markup language for structuring web pages.
- **CSS with Bootstrap:** Styling framework for enhancing the visual presentation of the application.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations:** Allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of client records.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes Maven for managing project dependencies, ensuring easier project setup and maintenance.
- **Server Deployment:** Facilitates local deployment using Glassfish Server for testing and development.
